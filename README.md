# Spin Decomposition
Mathematica notebook to study four-vector notations. In particular, his is a companion repository to the paper [23xx.xxxx](), used to prove the four vector extension of the spin decomposition

## Package to install
The package [xAct](http://xact.es/) is necessary to run the codes.

## How to use files
One can simply clone the repository and then open the notebooks. (Alternatively, it is possible to click on "View Raw" file, select all text (Ctrl A), copy it (Ctrl C), paste it (Ctrl V) into an empty Mathematica page and select "Yes" to interpreting the text.)

## Content
* [Spin Decomposition](https://github.com/crigouzzo/spin-decomposition/blob/main/Spin_Decomposition.nb) - This notebook allows to prove the spin decomposition, Eq(18) to Eq(20) of the companion paper, as well as general comments about the choice of the gauge in the supplementary information [23xx.xxxx](). More generally, it can also easily be extended to manipulate any cumbersome computations such as $F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}$, $F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \alpha}$ etc.
